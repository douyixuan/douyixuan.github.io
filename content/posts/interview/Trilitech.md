Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer, Triton Compiler position at OpenAI. With a strong background in GPU computation acceleration and compiler development, I believe my experience aligns well with the requirements of this role.

In my first role, I worked extensively with NVIDIA GPUs, implementing computational acceleration for a [desktop software](https://www.ultrasine.cn/us_RTSA). I developed signal processing algorithms such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which required in-depth research and optimization of NVIDIA GPU architecture and CUDA kernels. This experience gave me a solid understanding of GPU computing and a deep appreciation for performance optimization.

My second role involved building [Cangjie](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40752076), a compiler for a new programming language, where I honed my skills in compiler design and gained familiarity with LLVM. I have a strong foundation in low-level programming and a passion for exploring new technologies, such as Mojo language, to stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.

I am genuinely enthusiastic about the transformative impact of AI and have been following OpenAI’s work closely. I am particularly inspired by ChatGPT, and I am eager to contribute to a company that is at the forefront of AI innovation. My experience with GPU acceleration, compiler design, and a solid understanding of deep learning principles make me a strong fit for this position.

I am confident that my technical skills and passion for AI align well with the goals of OpenAI, and I am eager to bring my expertise to your team. I am available to start working remotely by December 1, and I am also open to applying for a U.S. work visa if needed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the Triton Compiler project and help advance OpenAI’s mission.

Sincerely,
Cedric
