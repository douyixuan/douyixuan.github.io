## Hi, I’m Cedric

### I am a software engineer

I am a Chinese software engineer (UTC+8) with a passion for system architecture principles and clean code. I enjoy exploring the fundamental principles of computer science. In a team of three, I helped develop a [desktop sofware](https://www.ultrasine.cn/us_RTSA) application. Additionally, I contributed to the development of the [Cangjie Programming Language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40752076). I made tools to help my friends.

### I like to keep me occupied

I love reading, photography, and films. I also enjoy spending time on fitness, playing tennis, badminton, and skiing. I believe our body is one of our most valuable assets, so we should take care of it and even cook for ourselves now and then. I also enjoy growing plants, caring for an aquarium, and feeding cats. I think it’s important to stay connected with nature.

### My Career Journey

I grew up in a small village without electricity, where my love for nature flourished. My grandmother raised me until I started school, and my aunt supported my education by enrolling me in a nearby primary school.

At 12, I encountered a computer for the first time at an internet café, where I was captivated by games and software. This experience ignited my curiosity about the technology behind the screen.

In middle school, I became engrossed in online gaming while still maintaining good academic performance. I discovered a textbook on Visual Basic, which laid the groundwork for my programming journey, despite limited access to practice.

In high school, I learned QB programming and received a laptop from my father, though we couldn’t afford internet access. My programming experience was limited, but I persevered in my studies and gained admission to a military college, where I studied computer science.

In military college, I thrived academically despite the challenges. My sophomore year included a C/C++ course, and I participated in the ACM programming contest, which provided opportunities to compete in nationwide contests and hone my skills. As graduation approached, I faced a pivotal moment: I had to serve as a commanding officer in the army due to my scholarship. Although I excelled in training, my internship revealed that I didn’t want to continue in that environment. Ultimately, a failed graduation running test led to my departure from the army and the start of my career journey in 2018.

## Reasons for Wanting the Job

For years, I have explored the technology behind screens and applications, from desktop software to web applications and compilers. I find it fascinating to maintain the reliability of systems. This role offers the opportunity to see the entire system landscape, from source code to production environments, and I want to deepen my understanding of these components.

After six years in the industry, I have developed a diverse skill set, working on desktop applications, compilers, and open-source initiatives. I learned C++, Golang, CI/CD, the Django web framework, as well as Linux and Docker. As I reflect on my journey, I resonate with Abraham Lincoln's words: "I am a slow walker, but I never walk back." I am grateful for the lessons learned along the way.

### Why 37signals

I am drawn to 37signals for its work-life-sleep balance, remote culture, innovative products, and the company’s commitment to meaningful work. I discovered 37signals through [Chen Hao](https://twitter.com/haoel), a respected figure in China, and was inspired by reading *ReWork* and using products like Hey and Basecamp. Hey particularly impressed me with its unique approach to email management.

My knowledge of cloud-native technologies expanded when I sought opportunities at MegaEase, but after Chen Hao's passing, I realized how rare companies like 37signals are in China. Revisiting the ideas on the 37signals website resonated deeply with me, reinforcing my belief that this is my dream company, like S.T.A.R. Labs in *the Flash.*

Having followed David’s blog, I was particularly impressed by his discussions on transitioning from Mac to Linux and moving from cloud to self-hosted data centers. Although I hesitated to apply for previous roles due to my unfamiliarity with Ruby, I feel confident in my qualifications for the current SRE position.

With experience in both small and large companies, I appreciate how 37signals fosters innovation and collaboration. I believe this is the ideal environment for me to contribute and grow alongside a talented team.

### In the end

While I may not have extensive experience in SRE, I am eager to learn and adapt quickly. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my unique perspective and skills to 37signals and excited to learn from the team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my fit for the Site Reliability Engineer role.

Best regards,
Cedric
